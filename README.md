# Typo Notes

The motivation behind Type Notes comes from the lack of options for note taking on the computer when the only input method is the keyboard, especially when there is a heavy reliance on symbols, like greek letters or math symbols. While normal Markdown supports this I have not been very successful adapting to its syntax so what I'm trying to build is a note taking language which allows its user to customize the symbols dictionary with the abreviations which are most natural to them and then render those notes to Markdown or some other wide-spread format.
